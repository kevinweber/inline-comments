Add Disqus Comment System to paragraphs. Inline Comments is inspired by Medium Notes and Quartz Annotations. Visitors click on bubbles to comment.

== Description ==
Inline Comments adds the great [Disqus](http://disqus.com/?utm_source=WordPressInlineComments) Comment System to the side of paragraphs and other specific sections (like headlines and images) of your post.

The comment area is shown when you click the comment count bubbles (left or right) beside any section.

Inline Comments is a further development from inlineDisqussions, a jQuery plugin by Tsachi Shlidor.

You can see a demo at [tsi.github.io/inlineDisqussions](http://tsi.github.io/inlineDisqussions?utm_source=WordPressInlineComments) (not a WordPress demo).


= Why should you use Inline Comments? =
* Inline Comments are an innovative approach on how to display comments.
* It’s simply different from „traditional“ comments you see on every website.
* Commentators can better refer to specific paragraphs/statements in an article.
* Readers can comment while reading (and don’t have to scroll to the very bottom).

Most people know Inline Comments from Medium as “Notes Feature” ([medium.com]( https://medium.com/about/5972c72b18f2)) and Quartz as “Annotation Feature” ([qz.com]( http://qz.com/111748/you-can-now-leave-annotations-in-the-margins-of-quartz/)).


= Features =
* Insert your Disqus shortname via the plugin’s options panel (required!).
* Insert selectors so you can control next to which sections the comment bubbles should be displayed.
* Highlight the active section.
* Choose where to position the bubbles: Left or right.
* Set background colour for comment threads.
* Set maximum width for comment threads.
* Responsive mode: The plugin works correctly, even on responsive websites (beta!).
* Add custom CSS code.
